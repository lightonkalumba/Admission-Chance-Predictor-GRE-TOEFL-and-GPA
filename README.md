# Admission-Chance-Predictor-GRE-TOEFL-and-GPA
This repository contains the Graduate Admission Prediction Dataset, which includes data on students applying to graduate programs at universities. The dataset can be used for building predictive models that estimate a student's Chance of Admit based on various factors such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, CGPA, and other features.

Dataset Overview
The dataset includes the following features:

GRE Score: Graduate Record Examination score (out of 340).
TOEFL Score: Test of English as a Foreign Language score (out of 120).
University Rating: Rating of the university (out of 5).
SOP (Statement of Purpose): Strength of the Statement of Purpose (out of 5).
LOR (Letter of Recommendation): Strength of the Letter of Recommendation (out of 5).
CGPA: Cumulative Grade Point Average (out of 10).
Research: Whether the student has research experience (binary: 1 for yes, 0 for no).
Chance of Admit: The chance of being admitted to the university (ranging from 0 to 1).
Target Variable:
Chance of Admit: A continuous value representing the probability of being admitted to the university, ranging from 0 to 1.
How to Use
Data Preparation:

You can load the dataset directly from this repository for training your models.
The dataset is cleaned and ready for use in machine learning models.
Training a Model:

You can use machine learning algorithms like RandomForestRegressor to predict the Chance of Admit based on the available features.
Example algorithms include Random Forest, Linear Regression, and Gradient Boosting.
Usage for Research:

This dataset is suitable for educational purposes, predictive modeling, and machine learning experimentation.
